# TODO
-use logging metrics to slow down pixel counting?
-options based in tuple ternary conditions
	* test = ("zero","one","two",etc...)[num]
-progress bars
-fix the random stopping and ending program? really random but annoying
	* pretty sure this is unfixable as its a problem with repl.it's server specs
	* attempted to fix by removing the dots for optimization (assigning pixels.append to a variable and using that, its faster) which increased speed on pictures around 1080p but still breaks if over
	* maybe throttle based on resolution?
-animate option from second generator
	* second gens:
